# Multi-Variant-Linear-Regression-on-20-Days-Routine-Dataset
This project implements a Multi-Variant Linear Regression model on a self-created dataset of a 20-day routine. The dataset includes multiple independent variables and one dependent variable.

## Dataset
- Sleep Hours: Number of hours of sleep per day.
- Food Quality Rank: Rank of the quality of food consumed (1 being poor, 10 being excellent).
- Working Hours: Number of hours worked per day.
- Health Condition Rank: Rank of overall health condition (1 being poor, 10 being excellent).
- Mood Rank: Rank of mood (1 being very low, 10 being very high).
- Productivity Rank: Rank of productivity (1 being very low, 10 being very high).
## Predictive Analysis
The multiple linear regression model explains the relationship between the continuous dependent variable (Productivity Rank) and multiple independent variables.

## Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
## Correlation Coefficients
The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables:

- Day: -0.061 (weak negative)
- Sleep Hours: 0.215 (weak positive)
- Food Quality Rank: 0.101 (very weak positive)
- Working Hours: -0.077 (weak negative)
- Health Condition Rank: 0.097 (very weak positive)
- Mood Rank: 0.754 (strong positive)
